Diverse Coders
==============

If you are female, trans, or non-binary, there are a lot of coders like
you! But sometimes it can be hard to find them.

Check out the following organizations.

* `PyLadies <http://www.pyladies.com/>`_
* `Django Girls <https://djangogirls.org/>`_
* `Girls Who Code <https://girlswhocode.com/>`_

PyLadies holds charity auctions at PyCon every year, raising over $20,000
every year to help support and promote coding amongst women.

If you are interested in getting started coding, or contributing to the Python
community, reach out to me or any of the organizations above.
