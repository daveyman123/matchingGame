Installation on the Mac
=======================

1. Go to the `Python website
   <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and download the
   Mac version that starts with a 3, rather than the one that starts with a
   Click on the download and install the program.

2. MacOS computers have a terminal window where a user can type commands
   and interact directly with the computer, without any windows or GUI
   applications popping up.  To start the terminal, open Spotlight
   (Command + Space) and type "Terminal" (without the quotes), then press
   enter. You can also locate the Terminal program by looking in the "Utilities"
   folder under your "Applications" folder.

3. Install the Python Arcade Library, (along with a library called PyObjC)
   by running the following command

``pip3 install PyObjC arcade``

4. Download the community edition of PyCharm for the Mac from the `Jetbrains
   website <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/>`_. Double click on the
   file you downloaded to install it.

5. Create a new project in PyCharm. Because the Mac often has multiple versions
   of Python installed on it, when creating a project make sure to select
   version 3.6.
