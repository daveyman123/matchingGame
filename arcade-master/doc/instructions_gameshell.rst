GameShell
=========

GameShell is a retro hand-held gaming console. If you liked the GameBoy, you'll
probably like GameShell. It is a small "Clockwork Pi" computer with a
320x240 screen, battery, speakers, and gaming keypad.

Best of all, you can run Arcade games on it!

You need to assemble the GameShell. At least, the one I was sent needed
assembly. It was an easy snap-together process that didn't take long.
I do recommend using a file or some sandpaper to get off
the extra plastic.

At the time of this writing, I haven't gotten sound to work yet.

**Disclaimer:** I was sent a free GameShell to get the Arcade library up and
running.
